# Wording

A RACE AGAINST THE CLOCK!

Wording is a simple yet addicting game that incorporates colors and numbers into small (or long) words. Press the right colors. Tap the correct numbers. But make sure the buttons are the same. Changes happen in the blink of an eye! Quick fingers and reflexes like a cat will be the key to reaching the top of the leaderboards! 

How to Play:

Tap the colored 0 and 1 buttons that match the word shown.
Complete the word before the time runs out.
